      <h2>About Anson</h2>
      <p>A self-taught junior software developer trying to start a career in tech. Specialising in JavaScript, with
        good exposure in Python. Most of my past projects have been built with Vue.js, and I've dipped into React and
        React
        Native to broaden my front-end toolkit. Comfortable using Git via the command line, and Docker to keep
        environments consistent.</p>

      <p>
        I moved to the UK just before Covid and used that time to reflect on what I wanted to do long term. Before
        relocating, I worked in a ship liner company that owned container vessels, which gave me exposure to large-scale
        operations and problem solving. Since moving here, I worked in a care home for a while and have now moved on to
        volunteering at the World Heritage Center in Bath, where I connect with visitors and share my knowledge of the
        city.

        I enjoy knitting and sewing. I like how they involve both structure and creativity. which combine logic with
        creativity. There are patterns to follow and basic techniques to learn, but also plenty of room to experiment
        and design something unique. I find the process of working step by step towards a finished piece both practical
        and rewarding.

        <summary>Why do I want a switch</summary>
        <p>
          I want to move into a career as a web developer because it offers both strong future prospects and the chance
          to do work I genuinely enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Programming itself is fun, and there’s a real sense of satisfaction when something I’ve built finally works
          after problem-solving and debugging. What makes it especially engaging is the freedom it allows. There are
          often multiple ways to solve the same problem, each with its own benefit, which keeps the work fresh and
          interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond that, I find programming intellectually stimulating, constantly challenging me to think creatively and
          logically.
        </p>
        <p>
          A career in web development feels like the perfect balance of stability, opportunity, and personal fulfilment.

        <summary>My favourite project!</summary>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/AnsonChung3/Battleship">Battleship</a> is my favourite project so far.</p>

        <p>I started to work on it when I wanted to start tackling my first reasonbly sized project. I experimented a
          lot of new tools
          with it. It was challenging to make but very satifying when I could share the link to my friends and they can
          <a href="https://ansonchung3.github.io/Battleship/">play a game</a> with it.
